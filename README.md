# Stock Data Pull Using Alpaca's API and AlphaVantage

This is a reusable dotpy file that will import, clean, and present in DataFrame format, any stock data available from the Alpaca API.

To use this, clone the repo, create a dotenv file with your Alpaca keys inside the same folder, and inside the "data_pull" function, replace what is in "tickers" with the symbol of the stock or stocks you would like to view.
